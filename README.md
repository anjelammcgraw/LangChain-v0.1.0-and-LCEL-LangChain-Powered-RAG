# 🤖 LangChain-v0.1.0 and LCEL: LangChain-Powered-RAG

In this repo, we'll build a Langchain Powered RAG using Pinecone, OpenAI, and LCEL. This project was done during week 3 of AI Makerspace's AI Engineering Bootcamp Cohort 1 (AIE1).

### ⚙️The colab link to the code is found and (will also be included in this repo) [here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vy_E5Jy9r0LKAqIpWjIQiptMKE1-8x8h?usp=sharing)

# ⚙️The Build Process

### Build 🏗️
* Create a Python 3.11 environment
* pip install jupyter
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* Create your RAG

### Task 1: 
* Install required libraries
* Create Pinecone Acct for API key
* Set environment variables
* Initiliaze Index on Pinecone

### Task 2: 
* Initiliaze a simple chain using LCEL
* Implement Naive RAG using LCEL
* Create a simple RAG app using Pinecone, Open AI, and LCEL
